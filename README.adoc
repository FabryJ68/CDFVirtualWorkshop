= CDF Workshop

== Introduction

In this hands-on workshop, you will build a full OT to IT workflow for an **IoT Predictive Maintenance** use case. Below is the architecture diagram, showing all the components you will setup over the lab exercises. While the diagram divides the components according to their location (factory, regional or datacenter level) in this workshop all such components will reside in one single host.

=== Before you start

* Everything is Case-Sensitive. 
* Check all your connections and spellings
* If you hit any problems like, for example, *MiNiFi Not Sending Messages*, check for clues in the <<troubleshooting>> section below.

=== Pre-requisites

* Laptop with a supported OS (Windows 7 not supported).
* A modern browser like Google Chrome or Firefox (IE not supported).

=== Connecting to your cluster

You instructor will give access to a registration link where you can request a cluster. You should have 2 addresses for you one-node cluster: the public DNS name and the public IP address. With those addresses you can test the following connectivity to your cluster:

. Ensure you can connect to the following service using your browser:

|Service|URL|Credentials
|Cloudera Manager|http://<public_dns>:7180/|`admin/admin`
|Edge Flow Manager|http://<public_dns>:10080/efm/ui/|
|NiFi|http://<public_dns>:8080/nifi/|
|NiFi Registry|http://<public_dns>:18080/nifi-registry/|
|Schema Registry|http://<public_dns>:7788/|
|SMM|http://<public_dns>:9991/|
|Hue|http://<public_dns>:8888/|`admin/admin`
|CDSW|http://cdsw.<public_IP>.nip.io/|`admin/supersecret1`

. Login into *Cloudera Manager* and familiarize yourself with the services installed
. Login into *Hue*. As you are the first user to login into Hue, you are granted admin privileges. At this point, you won't need to do anything on Hue, but by logging in, CDH has created your HDFS user and folder, which you will need for the next lab.

Below a screenshot of Chrome open with 8 tabs, one for each service.
